		<div>Cosmopolitan College of Commerce & Technology taught me to take initiative, to strive to be on top, to push myself further. The methods of teaching here have also developed my character, as I am now more confident when speaking in front of a public crowd. Although academics are an important part of education, at CCCT, we are put through many hands-on activities which develop our skills which would then become valuable assets when we seek employment.

		<div>Talking about student attachment; youth and sports department really appreciates all students from Cosmopolitan College that has been sent. We can see that all the student coming to this department has shown their skills and interest. They really show their commitment as well as perform whatever task that has been given to them. So myself as a coordinator, for these students, I really appreciate their courage and would like to welcome more. Thank you.
